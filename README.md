# Description
This project is a Python-based tool that generates SEO-friendly article descriptions using the LangChain framework and OpenAI's GPT-4o model. It reads an article from a text file, processes it with a creative language model configuration, and produces a concise description optimized for search engine visibility.

# Features

Article Processing: Reads article content from a specified text file.
SEO-Friendly Output: Generates descriptions tailored for search engine optimization.
LangChain Integration: Utilizes LangChain's prompt templates and chaining for structured AI interactions.
Configurable Models: Supports creative response generation using OpenAI's GPT-4o model with adjustable temperature settings.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt):
langchain
langchain-openai
python-dotenv


An OpenAI API key stored in a .env file.
A text file containing the article content (e.g., article.txt) in the specified directory.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/neuro-symbolic-ai-description-generator.git
cd neuro-symbolic-ai-description-generator


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Create a .env file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here


Place your article text file (e.g., article.txt) in the src/datapool/ directory.

Usage

Ensure the article file path and name are correctly specified in the script (article_source_path and article_content).
Run the script:python src/main.py


The script will output an SEO-friendly description for the article titled "Unlocking the Future: The Rise of Neuro-Symbolic AI Agents".

Dependencies

langchain: Framework for building applications with LLMs.
langchain-openai: LangChain integration for OpenAI models.
python-dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file.

# Notes

The script uses the gpt-4o model. Ensure your OpenAI API key has access to this model.
The read_file_txt utility function is assumed to be defined in src/utilities/utils.py. Ensure it is implemented to read text files correctly.
The article file path is hardcoded in the script. Modify article_source_path and article_content as needed.
